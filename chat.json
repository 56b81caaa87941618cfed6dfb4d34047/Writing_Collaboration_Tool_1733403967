        "content": "\nI have implemented the StakingContract based on your instructions. Here's a summary of the implementation:\n\n1. The contract allows users to stake tokens, withdraw them, and claim rewards.\n2. It uses OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20, Ownable, and Math libraries for secure operations.\n3. The staking token address is set to a placeholder value in the constructor. You should change this to the actual token address after deployment using the setStakingToken function.\n4. The reward rate is initially set to 0.001 tokens per second per staked token. This can be adjusted using the setRewardRate function.\n5. Rewards are calculated based on the staking duration and amount.\n\nCaveats and assumptions:\n1. The contract assumes that the staking token has sufficient decimals to handle the reward calculations accurately.\n2. The contract doesn't have a limit on the total staked amount or individual stakes.\n3. The reward token is the same as the staking token. If you need a different reward token, the contract would need to be modified.\n\nTo deploy and interact with the contract:\n1. Deploy the contract.\n2. Call setStakingToken to set the correct staking token address.\n3. Users can then stake tokens (after approving the contract to spend their tokens), withdraw staked tokens, and claim rewards.\n4. The owner can adjust the reward rate if needed.\n\nRemember to thoroughly test the contract and consider having it audited before deploying it on the mainnet.\n",
